# Simple Kafka Consumer Example

This example demonstrates how to use the DS Event Stream Go SDK to consume events from a Kafka topic. It loops until it finds at least one message or reaches the configured limits.

## Features

- **Persistent message search**: Loops until finding at least one message
- **Configurable retry behavior**: Set maximum attempts and total timeout
- **Flexible topic selection**: Choose which topic to consume from
- **Event details display**: Shows formatted event information
- **Enhanced error handling**: Detailed explanations for common connection issues
- **Connection diagnostics**: Shows bootstrap servers for debugging
- **Smart timeout handling**: Uses short timeouts per attempt with overall limit
- **Progress feedback**: Shows real-time progress of consumption attempts

> ✅ **Status**: Recently updated with robust looping and retry logic

## Usage

### Quick Start

Run directly with Go:

```bash
go run main.go -password=your-kafka-password
```

Or with custom username:

```bash
go run main.go -username=your-username -password=your-kafka-password
```

### Command Line Options

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `-username` | string | `ds.consumption.ingress.v1` | Kafka SASL username |
| `-password` | string | - | Kafka SASL password (required) |
| `-group` | string | `example-consumer-group` | Consumer group ID |
| `-topic` | string | `ds.workflow.pipeline.job.requested.v1` | Kafka topic to consume from |
| `-timeout` | duration | `30s` | Total timeout for finding a message |
| `-max-attempts` | int | `10` | Maximum number of read attempts |
| `-from-end` | bool | `false` | Start consuming from the end of the topic (skip existing messages) |

### Examples

1. **Basic usage with required password**:
```bash
go run main.go -password=supersecret
```

2. **Quick test with shorter timeout**:
```bash
go run main.go -password=supersecret -timeout=10s -max-attempts=3
```

3. **Custom username and password**:
```bash
go run main.go -username=myuser -password=supersecret
```

3. **Custom topic and timeout**:
```bash
go run main.go -password=supersecret -topic=user-events -timeout=60s
```

4. **Custom consumer group**:
```bash
go run main.go -password=supersecret -group=my-consumer-group
```

### Expected Output

When consumer runs successfully (recent run):
```
Starting simple consumer example...
Group ID: example-consumer-group
Topic: ds.workflow.pipeline.job.requested.v1
Bootstrap servers: [b0.dev.kafka.ds.local:9095]
Reading one event from topic 'ds.workflow.pipeline.job.requested.v1' with 30s timeout...
No message received within 30s timeout
✅ Consumer example completed successfully
```

When an event is available:
```
Starting simple consumer example...
Group ID: example-consumer-group
Topic: ds.workflow.pipeline.job.requested.v1
Bootstrap servers: [b0.dev.kafka.ds.local:9095]
Reading one event from topic 'ds.workflow.pipeline.job.requested.v1' with 30s timeout...
📨 Received event:

```

## How It Works

1. **Setup**: Creates Kafka consumer with SASL authentication
2. **Read**: Attempts to read one event from the specified topic
3. **Display**: Shows formatted event details if received
4. **Exit**: Cleanly shuts down after processing one event or timeout

## Configuration

The example uses:
- **Username**: `ds.consumption.ingress.v1` (default, can be overridden with `-username`)
- **Environment**: Development environment with internal bootstrap servers
- **Authentication**: SASL SCRAM-SHA-512

## Dependencies

- Go 1.23+
- github.com/grasp-labs/ds-event-stream-go-sdk
- Access to Kafka cluster with proper credentials

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Password is required"**: Use the `-password` flag
2. **EOF Error**: This usually means Kafka brokers are not accessible
   ```
   ❌ Connection Error (EOF): error dialing all brokers, one of the errors: EOF
   ```
   **Solutions:**
   - Check if Kafka cluster is running
   - Verify network connectivity to brokers (`b0.dev.kafka.ds.local:9095`)
   - Check firewall and security group settings
   - Ensure you're on the correct network (VPN if required)

3. **Connection Refused**: Kafka is not running on the specified ports
4. **Authentication failed**: Verify the password is correct
5. **Topic not found**: Ensure the topic exists or use a different topic name

### Debug Tips

- The consumer shows bootstrap servers on startup: `Bootstrap servers: [b0.dev.kafka.ds.local:9095]`
- Increase timeout with `-timeout=60s` for slower networks
- Try different topics with `-topic=your-topic-name`
- Check Kafka cluster connectivity before running

### What does EOF mean?

**EOF (End of File)** in Kafka context means the connection to the broker was closed unexpectedly. This is **NOT** about empty queues - it's a connectivity issue. Common causes:

- 🔌 **No connection**: Brokers are down or unreachable
- 🌐 **Network issues**: DNS resolution, routing, or firewall problems  
- 🏠 **Wrong address**: Incorrect broker hostnames or ports
- 🔒 **Security**: Network policies blocking the connection

If you want to check for empty queues, you'll get a timeout instead of EOF.
